# Encrypting traffic between Kibana and Elasticsearch

# 1. Enabling TLS on the HTTP layer in Elasticsearch. 

# Generate a private key and X.509 certificate. 
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca

#(3last1c)
p - elast1c

# By default the 'ca' mode produces a single PKCS#12 output file which holds:
#     * The CA certificate
#    * The CA's private key

# If you elect to generate PEM format certificates (the -pem option), then the output will
# be a zip file containing individual files for the CA certificate and private key

# Please enter the desired output file [elastic-stack-ca.p12]: 3last1c
# Enter password for 3last1c :
